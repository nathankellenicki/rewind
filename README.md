Rewind
=======

Rewind - A personal timeline and distributed social network engine built in Javascript/ES6.

Usage
-------

Install io.js\* v.1.6.3 or above.

1. npm install
2. npm start
3. Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000/

\*Rewind uses ES6 features natively and is therefore not compatible with Node.js out-of-the-box. You may be able to transpile with Babel, but this is untested.
